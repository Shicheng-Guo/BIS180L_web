*_Please answer the following questions which are each worth 2 points. Be clear and concise with any written answers. Late assignments will be penalized with a 2pt deduction without prior communication of extenuating circumstances._*


__Q1__. Create a table that indicates blastp runtime as a function of
threshold value.  Is there a linear relationship?  Why does does
changing the threshold change the search time?

__Q2__.  How much faster is blastp than water under default parameters?

__Q3__.  What search parameters (matrix and threshold) would you use to
search two proteomes? Justify your answer.

__Q4__.  How long will it take to search two proteomes (given the above)?

__Q5__.  Using E-value to determine the best match, find a worm gene with a single fly ortholog and record their names and the reciprocal E-Values.  Is there more than one fly "hit" for your worm gene?  If so how do you decide if there is a single orthlog?

__Q6__.  What logic would you use to find orthologs automatically using BLAST?

__Q7__.  Discuss what makes orthology difficult to determine by the reciprocal BLAST method.

__Q8__.  How many paralogs did you find for T21B10.2a and for B0213.10?  What criteria did you use?

__Q9__.  Discuss what makes paralogy difficult to determine by BLAST.

__Q10__.  Is alignment score sufficient for determining orthology or paralogy? What other sources of information from the BLAST output might be useful?  What other types of analyses would be helpful?
