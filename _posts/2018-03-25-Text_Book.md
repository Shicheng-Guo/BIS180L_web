We will use [Vince Buffalo's](http://www.vincebuffalo.com/) excellent book [Bioinformatics Data Skills](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do).

This book is available [online for free](https://search.library.ucdavis.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01UCD_ALMA51247510250003126&context=L&vid=01UCD_V1&lang=en_US&search_scope=everything_scope&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,vince%20buffalo&mode=Basic) through the UC Davis Library (on campus or [VPN](https://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/ul/services/connect/) connection required).  UC is licensed for simultaneous access by 28 people.  If that doesn't work for you, you can buy it [direct from the publisher](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do) or from [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Bioinformatics-Data-Skills-Reproducible-Research/dp/1449367372).  As of this posting Amazon is cheaper and has used copies as well.

Additionally we will use [Hadley Wickham's](http://hadley.nz/) also excellent book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) which is available [online for free](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).  If you would like a physical copy, here is the [amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/R-Data-Science-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1491910399)
