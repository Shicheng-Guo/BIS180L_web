__UPDATE__

In some cases there may be a __NEW__ .vdi file created in the snapshots folder

You should copy __ALL_ .vdi files in the `Snapshots` folder that are newer than April 1.

__ALSO__ If you are moving more than one .vdi file you need to copy the `BIS180L2016.vbox` file which is in `Computer\Local Disk (C:)\BIS180L`
