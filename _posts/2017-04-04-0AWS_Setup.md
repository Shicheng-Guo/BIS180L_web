# Background

Most bioinformatics software runs on Linux or unix (including Mac) operating systems.  For this class we will work in a Linux environment.  Since the computer lab machines run Windows this presents a problem.  To overcome this problem we will run Linux in a virtual cloud environment.

[What is Linux?](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux)

Specifically we will use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/).  AWS is a cloud computing resource provider.  We will run virtual Linux machines on AWS servers and then use a [virtual network connection (VNC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) to display the "desktop" of the virtual machine to be displayed on our local computer.

AWS is not free, but as a UC Davis student you receive $100 credit.  That should be enough credit for you to complete this class __so long as you suspend your instance when not in use__.  For example a 2 cpu, 8GB instance costs $0.122 per hour, so you should have more than 800 hours available.

It is possible to connect to your AWS not only from the computers in this room but also from your own personal computer, or from computers in other computer labs.  To use your own computer you need to install the [RealVNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/) on your computer.  If you want to use other campus computer rooms, RealVNC has been installed on computers in:
* 2020 SLB (this room)
* 2060 SLB (next door)
* 102 Wellman
* 182 Shields
* 78 Hutchison
* 2101 SCC
You can check the [schedule](http://computerrooms.ucdavis.edu/available/) of these rooms to see when they are available.

If you are curious about what version of Linux we are using and how we created the AWS virtual machine, please see [this document](https://github.com/johnny3420/AWS_Setup/blob/master/AWS_Configuration.md).

## Creating your BIS180L instance

An _instance_ is your realized virtual machine.  It is an _instance_ of a machine _image_ that defines the programs, files, and operating system.

1. Go to [your ec2 console](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1)
  * Make sure it says N.California in the top right corner
2. Click on the blue button in the middle of the screen saying "Launch Instance"
  * It should say "Note: Your instances will launch in the US West (N. California) region"
   ![EC2_Home]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Home.png)
3. Click on Community AMIs in the menu on the left
4. In the search bar search for BIS180L
5. Select BIS180L - ami-b18cd2d1
  ![EC2_AMI]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_AMI.png)
6. On next page click on the 4th option down
  ![EC2_Instance]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Instance.png)
  * It should say "t2.medium (Variable ECUs, 2 vCPUs, 2.5 GHz, Intel Xeon Family, 4 GiB memory, EBS only)" on the screen now
7. Click "6. Configure Security Group" at the top of the page
8. Make sure "create a new security group" is selected. Then change Type to All TCP
  ![EC2_Security]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Security.png)
9. Click Review and launch at the bottom of the page
10. Click Launch
11. Select "Create a new key pair"
  ![EC2_Key]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Key.png)
  * Name it whatever you want
  * Click the Download button
  * Press "Launch Instances"
  
## Attaching Permanent IP address to instance

[Internet Protocol (IP) addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) are used to connect to various resources on the internet.  We want to assign a _permanent_ IP address to your instance so that you know where to find it.

1. Go to [AWS Elastic IPs](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#Addresses:sort=publicIp)
  ![EC2_Elastic]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Elastic.png)
2. Click "Allocate New Address"
3. Click on "Actions" followed by "Associate Address"
4. On the pop-up window click on the instance box and the name of your instance will pop up, click on it followed by "Associate" at the bottom of the window
  ![EC2_Associate]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Associate.png)

## Connecting to your Instance for the first time 

For our initial connection we need to connect using a text-based [ssh]() connection.  For a windows computer see the section immediately below, using PuTTY.  If you are using a Mac (or Linux) computer to connect please skip to the next section.

__Connecting this way will only be used doing initial setup and in case something goes wrong__

### PuTTY

#### Convert Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen

1. Start PuTTYgen (for example, from the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTYgen**).
2. Under **Type of key to generate**, choose **RSA**. ![puttygen-key-type]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/puttygen-key-type.png)
3. Choose **Load**. By default, PuTTYgen displays only files with the
   extension .ppk. To locate your .pem file, select the option to
   display files of **all files** types. ![puttygen-load-key]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/puttygen-load-key.png)
4. Select your **.pem** file for the key pair that you specified when you launched your instance, and then choose Open. Choose **OK** to dismiss the confirmation dialog box.
5. Choose **Save private key** to save the key in the format that PuTTY can use. PuTTYgen displays a warning about saving the key without a passphrase. Choose **Yes**.
6. Specify the **same** name for the key that you used for the key pair (for example, my-key-pair). PuTTY automatically adds the .ppk file extension.

#### Connect to your server with Putty

1. Start PuTTY (from the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTY**).
2. In the Category pane, select **Session** and enter user_name@public_dns_name. {IMAGE A}
3. Under **Connection type**, select **SSH** and double check that the port is
22 ![Putty-Session]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Putty-Session.png)
4. In the Category pane, expand **Connection**, expand **SSH**, and then select **Auth**.
5. Click **Browse** and Select the **.ppk** file that you generated for your key pair, and then choose **Open**. ![Putty_Auth]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Putty_Auth.png)
6. If this is the first time you have connected to this instance, PuTTY displays a security alert dialog box that asks whether you trust the host you are connecting to. Choose **Yes**. 
7. You should now be logged into your Instance 

#### First time Setup

1. While logged into your Instance
2. Enter `sudo passwd ubuntu`
  * Enter a new password you want to use
  * This password will be used to log into Rstudio and to log into your instance if you lose you keypair file
  * Write down this password if lost we have no way of accessing your instance and data
  
## Connecting to your Desktop Interface

1. Open whatever VNC viewer you wish to use. IE [RealVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/)
2. Your VNC server will be your Public IP you noted earlier except you'll add ":1: to the end of it
  * Ex: 127.0.0.0:1
3. You will be asked to enter a password, the password is "Genomics"
4. You should now be able to see your desktop
![EC2_Terminal]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_VNC.png)


## Connecting to your Instance through terminal (extra)
1. Go to [your AWS console](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#Instances:sort=securityGroupNames)
  ![EC2_Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Overview.png)
  * Here you'll find your instance
  * Take note of your Public IP (you'll need this later)
2. Click Connect (This will open a new window)
  ![EC2_Connect]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Connect.png)
  * Under Example: copy the line which starts with "ssh"
  4. Open up Putty your Terminal interface (ie. GitBash (Windows), Terminal(Mac))
5. Paste in the line you copied
  ![EC2_Terminal]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Terminal.png)
  * You will have to change where it says "root" and replace it with "ubuntu"
  * I will need to add some notes for using putty to connect to
6. You should now be logged into your Instance
