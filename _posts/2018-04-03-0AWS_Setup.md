# Background

Most bioinformatics software runs on Linux or unix (including Mac) operating systems.  For this class we will work in a Linux environment.  Since the computer lab machines run Windows this presents a problem.  To overcome this problem we will run Linux in a virtual cloud environment.

[What is Linux?](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux)

Specifically we will use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/).  AWS is a cloud computing resource provider.  We will run virtual Linux machines on AWS servers and then use a [virtual network connection (VNC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) to display the "desktop" of the virtual machine to be displayed on our local computer.

AWS is not free, but as a UC Davis student you receive $100 credit.  That should be enough credit for you to complete this class __so long as you suspend your instance when not in use__.  For example a 2 cpu, 8GB instance costs $0.122 per hour, so you should have more than 800 hours available.

It is possible to connect to your AWS not only from the computers in this room but also from your own personal computer, or from computers in other computer labs.  To use your own computer you need to install [VNC Viewer](https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/tigervnc/1.8.0) on your computer.

* For Macs, download [TigerVNC-1.8.0.dmg](https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/download_file?file_path=TigerVNC-1.8.0.dmg).  
* For PCs you want "vncviewer" not the full "TigerVNC"
  * Try [vncviewer-1.8.0.exe](https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/download_file?file_path=vncviewer-1.8.0.exe) for a 32 bit system.
  * Or [vncviewer64-1.8.0.exe](https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/download_file?file_path=vncviewer64-1.8.0.exe) for a 65 bit system.
* Alternatively, the Java version [VncViewer-1.8.0.jar](https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/download_file?file_path=VncViewer-1.8.0.jar) should work on any system 

If you want to use other campus computer rooms, VNC Viewer has been installed on computers in:
* 2020 SLB (this room)
* 102 Wellman
* 182 Shields
* 78 Hutchison
* 2101 SCC
* 246 MU

You can check the [schedule](http://computerrooms.ucdavis.edu/available/) of these rooms to see when they are available.

If you are curious about what version of Linux we are using and how we created the AWS virtual machine, please see [this document](https://github.com/johnny3420/AWS_Setup/blob/master/AWS_Configuration.md).

## Creating your BIS180L instance

An _instance_ is your realized virtual machine.  It is an _instance_ of a machine _image_ that defines the programs, files, and operating system.

1. Go to [your ec2 console](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1)
  * Make sure it says N.California in the top right corner
2. Click on the blue button in the middle of the screen saying "Launch Instance"
  * It should say "Note: Your instances will launch in the US West (N. California) region"
   ![EC2_Home]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Home.png)
3. Click on Community AMIs in the menu on the left
4. In the search bar search for BIS180L
5. Select `BIS180L-04Apr17 - ami-9f9fc5ff`
  ![EC2_AMI]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_AMI.png)
6. On next page click on the 4th option down
  ![EC2_Instance]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Instance.png)
  * It should say "t2.medium (Variable ECUs, 2 vCPUs, 2.5 GHz, Intel Xeon Family, 4 GiB memory, EBS only)" on the screen now
7. Click "3. Configure instance"
  * Check the box that says "Enable termination protection".  This will help to keep you from deleting your virtual machine (and losing your work) by mistake. ![EC2_termination]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_termination.png)
8. Click on "4. Add storage"
  * Ensure that the box that says "Delete on termination" is _NOT checked_.  This will help preserve your work if you do terminate your virtual machine.  ![EC2_EBS]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_dont_delete_EBS.png)
9. Click "6. Configure Security Group" at the top of the page
10. Make sure "create a new security group" is selected. Then change Type to All TCP
  ![EC2_Security]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Security.png)
11. Click Review and launch at the bottom of the page
12. Click Launch
13. Select "Create a new key pair"
  ![EC2_Key]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Key.png)
  * Name it whatever you want
  * Click the Download button
  * Press "Launch Instances"
  
## Attaching Permanent IP address to instance

[Internet Protocol (IP) addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) are used to connect to various resources on the internet.  We want to assign a _permanent_ IP address to your instance so that you know where to find it.

1. Go to [AWS Elastic IPs](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#Addresses:sort=publicIp)
  ![EC2_Elastic]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Elastic.png)
2. Click "Allocate New Address"
3. Click on "Actions" followed by "Associate Address"
4. On the pop-up window click on the instance box and the name of your instance will pop up, click on it followed by "Associate" at the bottom of the window
  ![EC2_Associate]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_Associate.png)
  
  Save this IP address. Write it down, or perhaps email it to yourself.  You can also find it on your AWS console anytime that you need it.

## Connecting to your Instance

There are two possible ways to connect to your instance.

1. Using a [Virtual Network Connection(VNC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing).  A VNC connection allows the screen of your virtual machine to be displayed on the screen of your local computer.  With a VNC you will be able to interact with your virtual machine as if it was here.
2. Using a [secure shell(ssh)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) text connection.  This allows you to send and receive text from your virtual machine's linux "console". A SSH connection is a good choice if your network connection is slow or if you don't need any graphical display.

### Connect to your instance via VNC

VNC connections work on a client/server model.  Your virtual machine is the server because it _serves_ its graphical display.  Your local machine is the client.

1. Start the Tiger VNCViewer on your local machine.  
* On the lab PCs click on the `start` menu on the bottom left then type "tiger" into the search box.
2. In the window that pops up type the IP Address of your virtual machine followed by ":1".  The ":1" denotes screen one on your virtual machine.  For example if your virtual machine IP address is 55.53.117.125 then you would enter "52.53.117.125:1". ![EC2_TigerVNC]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_TigerVNC_IP.png)
3. Press the Connect button.
4. When you are asked for a password enter the default password of "Genomics"
5. The window now displays the desktop of your virtual Linux machine.  Nifty! ![EC2_Terminal]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_VNC.png)

### Change your passwords

There are two passwords associated with your virtual machine, one for the user account, and one for the VNC viewer.  We need to create or change both.

#### VNC Password

Right now everyone has the same password for their VNC connection _and_ that password is listed publicly on this website.  Very bad!  So we need to change the VNC password.

1. Click on the terminal emulator icon at the bottom of the screen. ![EC2_terminal1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/EC2_terminal1.png).  This opens a Linux command line terminal.  More about this later on today.  At the prompt type "vncpasswd"
2. When asked, enter a new password.  We recommend using a [strong password](https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/), either of at least 12 characters, including numbers and symbols, or 3-4 _random_ words strong together with dashes.

#### Create a password for your account.

While we are at it, let's create an overall password for your account.  The username for your account is "ubuntu". To create a password for this account:

1. While still in terminal type "sudo passwd ubuntu"
2. Enter a new password.  It can be the same password you use for VNC or a different password, your choice.


### How to stop your instance

1. Click instances on the left hand corner and select your running instance
2. Click **Actions** then **Instance State** and then **Stop**
3. When you are ready to work on your instance again change the state to **Start**
 ![Stop_instance]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/stop-instance.png)



## Optional: Connect via SSH

Optionally you can learn how to connect to your instance via an SSH text connection.  While not necessary for this class, this would be the standard way to connect to a Linux server for many people.  It is much better when the network is slow.

For a windows computer see the section immediately below, using PuTTY.  If you are using a Mac (or Linux) computer to connect please skip to the next section.

### PuTTY

#### Convert Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen

1. Start PuTTYgen (for example, from the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTYgen**).
2. Under **Type of key to generate**, choose **RSA**. ![puttygen-key-type]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/puttygen-key-type.png)
3. Choose **Load**. By default, PuTTYgen displays only files with the
   extension .ppk. To locate your .pem file, select the option to
   display files of **all files** types. ![puttygen-load-key]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/puttygen-load-key.png)
4. Select your **.pem** file for the key pair that you specified when you launched your instance, and then choose Open. Choose **OK** to dismiss the confirmation dialog box.
5. Choose **Save private key** to save the key in the format that PuTTY can use. PuTTYgen displays a warning about saving the key without a passphrase. Choose **Yes**.
6. Specify the **same** name for the key that you used for the key pair (for example, my-key-pair). PuTTY automatically adds the .ppk file extension.

#### Connect to your server with Putty

1. Start PuTTY (from the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTY**).
2. In the Category pane, select **Session** and enter user_name@public_dns_name. {IMAGE A}
3. Under **Connection type**, select **SSH** and double check that the port is
22 ![Putty-Session]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Putty-Session.png)
4. In the Category pane, expand **Connection**, expand **SSH**, and then select **Auth**.
5. Click **Browse** and Select the **.ppk** file that you generated for your key pair, and then choose **Open**. ![Putty_Auth]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Putty_Auth.png)
6. If this is the first time you have connected to this instance, PuTTY displays a security alert dialog box that asks whether you trust the host you are connecting to. Choose **Yes**. 
7. You should now be logged into your Instance 

## Connecting to your Instance through terminal

If you are on a Mac or Linux machine and want to make an SSH connection to your vritual machine, then:

1. Save your .pem file somewhere and note the path.
2. Open the Terminal application
3. Type 

    ssh -i JulinMar30.pem ubuntu@52.53.117.125
    
But replace the "JulinMar30.pem" with the path to your .pem file and the "52.53.117.125" with the IP address of your instance.
