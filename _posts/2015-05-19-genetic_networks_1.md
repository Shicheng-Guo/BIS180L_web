## Overall Learning Objectives
* Learn how to represent biological data as graphs
* Learn how graphs help us interpret relationships between data
* Apply this learning to gene co-expression and phenotype dataset

## Day 1 Concepts

### Nodes
* abstract concept that can represent data or process
* examples of social nodes

### Relationships
* adjacency 
* corr based networks
* other weightings
* social networks examples

### Graphs
* intro to graphs
* igraph basics
* now code simple social network by hand
* ask question that requires following information along network

### Brief intro of shade avoidance and dataset we will be working with
* see how much Julin did this

### Gene co-expression networks and phenotype networks
* transition from social network to gene-gene interaction example
* code small shade avoidance network beforehand to play with
* ask biologically motivated question with simulated shade network

### Break into teams for network construction
* have each team (or set of) create networks for tissue types - need to double check time
* create adjacency network first- visualize with heatmap
* use either WGCNA or Network package to create full network - need to do speed comparisons
