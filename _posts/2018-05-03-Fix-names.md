title: Fix names for GWAS
---

It turns out that `wgs` in SNPassoc does not know how to deal with names that have spaces in them.

i.e. if you want to do a a GWAS on `Amylose content` it won't work unless you change the name.

Change the name like this to get rid of the space:

```
colnames(snps3)[colnames(snps3)=="Amylose content"] <- "Amylose.content"
```
