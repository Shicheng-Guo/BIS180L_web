UC is licensed for simultaneous access by 28 people.  If that doesn't work for you can buy it [direct from the publisher](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do) or from [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Bioinformatics-Data-Skills-Reproducible-Research/dp/1449367372).  As of this posting Amazon is cheaper and has used copies as well.
