What if you didn't have to back to the Linux terminal everytime you wanted to make a commit to your repository.

Guess what?  __You Don't!__

## Integration of git and RStudio

The makers of RStudio want to make it easy to use Git from within R studio.

### Projects in RStudio

Before using git from RStudio we first have to create a project.

RStudio projects are a way to organize, well, your projects.  When you tell RStudio that you are working on a project it will remember the home directory of that project and any files that you had open.  You can switch projects within RStudio.  It is a handy way to keep things organized.

Because we are limited to a single repo for each student in BIS180L we will have a single RStudio project for all of the assignments combined.  In an ideal world it would be better to have a separate project for each assignment, but that won't work with our setup.

To create a new project

* open RStudio
* Click on the "Project:(None)" button on the top right-hand side of the window.

* Select "Existing Diretory"
* Navigate to the "BIS180L_Assignments_Your.Name" directory and select it

* Click on "Create Project"

### Git

RStudio recognizes that this is already a git repository.

* Click on the "Git" tab in the upper right-hand pane
* Untracked files are shown with a "?"
* Files that have been modified since the last commit are shown with a "M"
* Files that are staged to be added are shown with an "A"

* If you want to stage a new or changed for for a commit click on the checkbox
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/RGitHub5.png)
* You can then click on "commit" to open up a new window that shows you the changes
* Type a commit message in the box and press commit!

* Note that there are also buttons to __push__ and __pull__ from the remote repository as well.
