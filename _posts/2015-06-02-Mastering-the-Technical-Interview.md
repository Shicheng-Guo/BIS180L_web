You've learned a lot of valuable information in this course and some of that might be tested as you search for a job. This guide will help you prepare for the technical interview and make sure that you are prepared to let your abilities shine.  

## What is a technical interview?

+ Way for interviewers to determine your coding ability and your critical thinking.
+ A test of your communication.
+ A way to test how you think on your feet.
+ A way to test your resilience.
+ A way to test your enthusiasm and curiousity.

## How can I succeed in a technical interview?

+ __Be able to articulate your technical abilities__
	+ Which languages, libraries, tools, APIs, IDEs, OS, etc. do you know
		+ RStudio = IDE, Git for version control, 
		+ Libraries/packages: ggplot2, shiny, edgeR, pvclust
		+ Languages: R, bash
		+ Linux
		+ Markdown
	+ Which bioinformatics platforms have you used
		+ From this class: BLAST, Smith-Waterman, FastQC, Tophat, QIIME, samtools, bamtools
	+ What is your level of contribution to coding projects
+ __Prepare for the position__
	+ Brush up on the bioinformatics platforms that would be used in this job. Know the input and output and if there are any disadvantages to that pipeline. Check blogs and review articles for this.
	+ Familiarize yourself with the basics of a language that is specified in the job title.
		+ Unique syntax elements (== vs ===, basic loops, etc.)
		+ It's ok if you don't know the specific language they are currently seeking 
	+ Listen to programming podcasts. It helps with your technical communication and you can pick up details from experts that are much harder to gain by just reading.

## How do I give the best answer to the coding question?

+ __Be prepared to answer their questions__
	+ Have paper and pen ready
	+ If in a video interview, you might want to have a text editor open
+ __Make sure you're clear on what they're asking__
	+ After they ask the question, pause, think about what they're asking, then do one or both of the following things:
		+ Ask a clarifying question if there is something you'd like more information about. 
			+ Sometimes questions are intentionally vague to see who is actually thinking about the problem at hand or to see who can find shortcomings in the logic presenting the problem.
			+ Only ask a question if it is based in genuine interest, curiousity, or clarification. Asking questions for the sake of asking questions makes you look self-inflated.
		+ Rephrase what they're asking to confirm that your understanding is accurate
+ __Make sure you're clear on how they'd like you to answer__
	+ Most interviewers will describe how they'd like you to answer but if they don't ask questions
	+ This might include level of depth (logic, pseudocode, full code) or the mode of your answer (oral, whiteboard, paper, etc.)
+ __Answer their question__
	+ Be thorough in your explanation
	+ Pause to think if you need it. It's ok for there to be brief moments of silence.
	+ Write things down and if in a digital interview tell them you are too. It's a good sign when a programmer/bioinformatician knows how to work through the abstraction outside of their text editor.
	+ Describe organized thoughts outloud. You don't want to ramble but showing your train of thought can be helpful and can help you stay organized
		+ Also, your interviewer may end up giving you a nudge in the right direction if you've already impressed him or her
	+ Speak clearly and confidently
	+ Ask questions again if you need more clarification
	+ Keep your energy up. 
		+ It's very obvious when people are fatigued or feel defeated. 
		+ The technical interview is often at the end of the interview so mentally prepare yourself for that.
	+ Remember to breathe. It can be stressful but you're also being scored on how you stress. Take it seriously but don't go into panic mode.
	+ When finished, ask them "Does that answer meet the depth that you're looking for?
+ __Be prepared to answer follow up questions to your answer__
	+ What are the advantages and disadvantages to your method?
	+ What is an alternative way to solve the question? This will basicially make you re-answer the question after you've already gone into the relieved I made it out alive. But breathe and remember you can do it!
	+ What is the computational efficiency to your method? Outside of the scope of this class but something you should be aware of.


### Sample Interview Question 1:
You are given a large list or array of 1,000 in length. It contains the integers 0-1,000 inclusive. Now I just said this list is only 1,000 in length which isn’t possible because 0-1,000 is in fact 1,001 numbers. One number is missing from the array. Your task is to develop an algorithm to determine which number is missing.

### Sample Interview Question 2:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
