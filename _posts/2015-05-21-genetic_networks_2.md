## Day 2 Concepts

## Network Comparisons
* comparisons of general network topologies
* summarize networks for each genotype treatment combo

## Network to trait correlations
* eigenvalues
* can explain phenotypes with gene expression?

## Network follow-up for enrichment
* gene expression enrichment

## Metabolic Networks
* comparing genes of metabolic pathways
* visualize

## Network Summary Statistics
* have all groups answer questions about pre-run general summary statistics
* leave some biological interpretation up to groups, but values will be the same to be easier to grade
