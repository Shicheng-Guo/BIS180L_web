Many of the following labs will be performed using [R](http://www.r-project.org/).  R is an open-source, multi-platform statistical programming langauge.  Many (bio)statisticians develop their algorithims in R and therefore it contains many of the latest techniques.  A related project, [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) extends R for bioinformatics analsyis.  While a command-line interface may seem old-fashioned it allow much greater flexibilty than is typically available through graphical user interfaces.

There are a number of different interfaces available for R.  We will use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) to interface with R running on your linux instance.  R and RStudio are also available for Mac and PC computers.

If you want to use R, Bioconductor, and Rstudio on your own computer you can do so for free, by following the links above.

## Introduction to R
Click on the Rstudio Icon ![Rstudio icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Rstudio_logo.png) at the bottom of your screen.
You will see a 3 or 4-paned window appear.

The left or lower left panel is the R console, where you can directly type commands into R.  More about the other panes later.

### The swirl tutorial

I have already installed swirl on the virtual machine.  If you are using R on a different computer you can install swirl with:

  install.packages("swirl")

Next tell R that you want to load the swirl package

  library(swirl)

And start the swirl tutorial.

    swirl()

When given the choice, choose "1: R Programming: The basics of programming in R".  There will be a delay while the tutorial is downloaded.  At the next prompt choose "1: R Programming".  Keep a markdown notebook to record what you learn.  Complete the following 8 tutorials within this course:

1) Basic Building Blocks  
(You can Skip 2)  
3) Sequences of Numbers  
4) Vectors  
5) Missing Values  
6) Subsetting Vectors  
7) Matrices and Data Frames
8) Logic (On this one you can stop if after you get to the 52% completion point)
(You can skip 9-11 for now)  
12) Looking at Data   

We will return to some of the other tutorials later.

Complete the `swirl()` tutorials 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 before continuing

## More about RStudio

R commands are written in R-script (.R) or R-markdown (.Rmd) files.  More on those differences below. To start a new R script files you can choose "File > New > R-Script", or click on the new document icon a the upper left of the window, or type Ctrl-shift-N.  This will create a new panel, upper left, in your RStudio window.

There are total of four panes in the RStudio window.

* Upper left: a text editor.  You will write your scripts/commands here.
* Lower left: the command line interface, or console.  While you can type commands here, I **strongly** encourage you instead to type them in the text editor mentioned above.  Output will appear here.
* Upper Right: This shows *objects* in your *workspace*.  Think of objects as containers or variables that hold things.  More about this later.
* Lower Right: A multipurpose window that can show:
  * Help
  * Plots
  * Files in your directory

## R files types

### R script files

A typical R analysis or program would be written as an `R script` (file extension .R).  You have just started a blank R-script file above.

R-script files contain R commands and comments.

Begin your script file with some information about what it is.
In this manual, code that you should type will generally be shown in a grey block such as:


```r
#Simple R Script for BIS180L
#Author: Julin Maloof
#Original Date: April 17, 2014
#Updated: April 19, 2017
```
Lines that begin with a pound sign `#` are comment lines and are ignored by R.  Type the text above into the script window in the upper left pane (replacing "Julin Maloof" with your name, changing the date info, and adding any additional information that you think is useful).

Now enter some simple R code into your script:

```r
print("Hello World!")
```
Type the text above into the script (upper-left) window.  Then with the cursor still on that line, hold down the control key (CMD key on Mac) and press the enter or return key.  This causes RStudio to copy the text from your script file, paste it into the console and "execute" the code.

If you wanted to save your script file then you could press `Ctrl-S` or choose "File > Save"

### R Markdown files

As an alternative file type you can use an R-flavored version of Markdown, [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), with the file extension ".Rmd".  Rmarkdown comes pre-installed in RStudio.  R markdown is particularly nice for authoring reports, either for your scientific colleagues, or in this case, for _turning in your BIS180L homework_.

Rstudio enables an interactive form of Rmarkdown called [R notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).  The format is the same as R Markdown but you see the results of your code embedded in your document as you go.  _We will use RMarkdown Notebooks for turning in assignments for this class._

Lets try it.

Start a new R Notebook.  Choose "File > New File > R Notebook" or click on the new file icon and choose R Notebook.

A new document will open with some template information in it.  Change title from "R Notebook" to something more informative like "Intro to R Notebook"

The cool thing about RMarkdown and R Notebooks is that embedded R code chunks are run and incorporated into the output.  **This is an ideal way to create reproducible reports and analyses**

To see this for yourself, click the right arrow in the code chink that contains `plot(cars)`, or place your cursor in the text there and press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`.

Voila!

To see how the fully formatted document would look, click the "Preview" button above your notebook (You will be prompted to enter a file name to save the notebook). Note that the preview will update every time you save your notebook file.

You can now remove everything below the lower "---" (line 4) in the R Notebook and enter your own content.

Lets re-create the "Hello World" program above. I can't get the formatting correct for the text below, so enter it into your .Rmd file even though it isn't code formatted.

__.Rmd code starts below this line__

\## A silly R program
This is the first program that Professor Maloof asked us to write in R

\`\`\`{r hello_world2}

print("Hello World")

\`\`\`

__.Rmd code stops above this line__

You can still execute R-code lines one at a time with `Ctrl-Enter` to check your code.  But when each chunk is complete you should run the entire chunk with the right arrow or by typing `Ctrl-Shift-Enter`

I recommend writing separate chunks for each bit of output to be produced.

You can automatically create a new code chunk in Rstudio by typing "Ctrl-Alt-I" or choosing "New Chunk" from the "Chunks" menu (upper right hand side of the text-editor window)

If you want to produce a PDF or even a Word document (horrors) instead, click the down arrow next to "Preview" and choose an alternative format instead.

Lets review what we know about R Markdown.

* R Markdown is very similar to markdown
* To denote R code, start the code block with \`\`\`{r SomeTitle} and then end it with \`\`\`
* Anything outside of the code block is formatted using normal Markdown rules.
* R studio has a built in rendering engine that will produce html or PDF files.

A handy [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) and [reference guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) are available and go into many more options than I have covered here.  You can also acccess these documents from the Help menu within Rstudio.

Now that you are done with the `swirl` tutorial you should **always** type your commands in the upper left window to create a script or R Notebook file to keep a record of what you have done.
