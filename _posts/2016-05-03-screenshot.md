title: How to save a screenshot in Linux
---
The GWAS lab asks you to include a screenshot.  Here are instructions on how to do that on your virtual Linux machine.

## On a Windows PC host

1. Get the screen in the state that you want to capture.
2. Press the "PrtScn" key.
3. The screenshot is now saved in your home directory `/home/bis180l_local`
3. If you want to edit (e.g. crop) or view the file, open the "Image Viewer" application by clicking on start button (lower left) > Accessories > Image Viewer.

## On a Mac host

I am not sure how to get the virtual machine to take a screenshot when you are using a mac host.  You can get virtualbox to take a screenshot by pressing the lefthand cmd-key and E (cmd-E), save that file to your mac, and then email or gdrive it to yourself on the virtual box.
