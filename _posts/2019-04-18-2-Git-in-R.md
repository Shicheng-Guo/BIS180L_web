## Integration of git and RStudio

The makers of RStudio have made it easy to use Git from within R studio.

## Projects in RStudio

Rstudio allows you to work in *projects* to help you keep your files organized.  Furthermore it allows these projects to be associated with a github repository.  There are two ways to associate a project with a git repository, either have Rstudio clone a github repository directly, or point it to an existing repository on your computer.

## Create a Rstudio project for this assignment by cloning a repository

Let's tell Rstudio to start a project for this lab assignment.

Go to github.com and find your `Assignment3_LastName.FirstName` repository.  Copy the link for cloning the repository.

Now in R choose "New Project" from the File menu.  A new dialog box will open as shown below.

![Rstudio Project]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Rstudio_project.png)

Click on "Version Control" and then "Git"

Paste the URL for your repository into the first line.  On the third line choose a parent directory (I use `Assignments`, a directory I previously created).

![Rstudio Git]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Rstudio_git.png)

Then click the Create Project button.

You now have an Rstudio Project for Assignment Three and it is linked to your github repository.

## Git from Rstudio

Now that RStudio knows that you are working with a git repository you can use its built-in tools to add, commit, push, and pull

* Click on the "Git" tab in the upper right-hand pane
* Untracked files are shown with a "?"
* Files that have been modified since the last commit are shown with a "M"
* Files that are staged to be added are shown with an "A"

* If you want to stage a new or changed file for a commit click on the checkbox
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/RGitHub5.png)
* You can then click on "commit" to open up a new window that shows you the changes
* Type a commit message in the box and press commit!

* Note that there are also buttons to __push__ and __pull__ from the remote repository as well.


## Alternative: Create a project from an existing folder

__BIS180L Students can skip this__

If you have already cloned your repository onto you computer but want to link that to Rstudio, to the following:

* open RStudio
* Click on the "Project:(None)" button on the top right-hand side of the window.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/RGitHub1.png)
* Select "New Project"
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/RGitHub2.png)
* Select "Existing Diretory"
* Navigate to the "Assignment_3_Your.Name" directory (that you cloned from github) and select it
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/RGitHub3.png)
* Click on "Create Project"
