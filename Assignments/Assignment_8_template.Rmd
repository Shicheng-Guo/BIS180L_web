## Assignment 8: Gene Networks 2

This should be a knittable .Rmd file.  Include this file, a .pdf and a .html when you turn in the assignment.

**Exercise 1:**
Based on this 0 or 1 representation of our network, what city is the most highly connected? *Hint: sum the values down a column OR across a row for each city*

What if you were to extend the range to 2000 miles in the above code. Does the highest connected city change? If so explain. 

**Exercise 2:**
What is the total number of nodes in the plot? 
What is the total number of edges in the plot?

**Exercise 3:**
Re-calculate the adjacency matrix with the cutoff value at 2300. Calculate the number of edges using the following code. What do you get?

**Exercise 4:**
Fill in the following 0 or 1 values for our gene network above.

**(Gene1)--(?)--(Gene2)**

**(Gene2)--(?)--(Gene3)**

**(Gene1)--(?)--(Gene3)**

**(Gene3)--(?)--(Gene4)**

**Exercise 5:**
Now we can do some calculations. If our cutoff is 0.85, how many edges do we have in our 255 node network? What if we increase our cutoff to 0.95?

**Exercise 6:**
Use the following code to plot our networks using different thresholds for connectivity. What patterns do you see in the visualization of this data? *Note: the second plot will take a while to render*

**Exercise 7:**
Use the following code to answer these two questions: In gene_graph85, what is the total graph density? In gene_graph85, what is the average path length? 


**Exercise 8:**
Using what you know about graphs, repeat your analysis of the smaller cities matrix. Show your code to answer these questions.
What is the graph density of the cities network with a 1500 mile flight range?
What is the average path length of the cities network with a 1500 mile flight range?
Find the shortest path between SEA and DC with 1500 mile flight range. Graph it.
Find the shortest path between SEA and DC with 2300 mile flight range. Graph it.
