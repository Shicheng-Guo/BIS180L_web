We will use git to turn in assignments

For assignment 1:

* Login to github
* You will see a new repository : "Assignment_1_LASTNAME.FIRSTNAME" where the names are your names!
* Clone the repository to your commputer
* cd into the repository
* edit the `assignment01.md` file there or replace it with one you have already worked on
* add, commit, and push your changes
* on github leave a comment "ready to be graded" in that repository

That's it!
