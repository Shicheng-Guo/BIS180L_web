How to take a screenshot on your AWS instance:

* Click on `Applications` (top left of your screen)
* Select `Run Program`
* In the Application Finder that opens type `xfce4-screenshooter`

The other option is to take a screenshot on your client computer (PC/Mac) and then upload that to github.

* PC: press the `PrtScn` button.
    * Open the `Paint` program and paste in your image.

* Mac: press CMD-SHIFT-4
